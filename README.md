# agen-audit

## What Is This?

`agen-audit` is to agent logs what `grep` is to text: a filter primitive. It reads the structured traces that `agen-log` produces and emits matching events to stdout. You can `grep` the log files directly, but `agen-audit` makes common questions easier. It handles date filtering, combines multiple criteria, and formats output nicely. Think of it as a convenience layer — the power is still in the log files themselves.

## Shell Agentics

Part of the [Shell Agentics](https://github.com/shellagentics) toolkit - small programs that compose via pipes and text streams to build larger agentic structures using Unix primitives. No frameworks. No magic. Total observability.

When you or another agent want to know what an agent did, you check the execution trace. Every command, every decision, every timestamp is inspectable with Unix tools. It's all Unix and it's all in the shell.

## NAME

**agen-audit** — query and inspect agent execution traces

## SYNOPSIS

```
agen-audit [FILTERS...] [OPTIONS]
```

## DESCRIPTION

`agen-audit` queries the JSONL log files created by `agen-log`. It supports filtering by date, agent, event type, and message content. Results can be output in human-readable or JSON format.

All filters are composable using AND logic — specifying multiple filters narrows the results.

This tool is part of the Shell Agentics toolkit, which implements AI agent systems using Unix primitives rather than frameworks or databases.

## FILTERS

**--today**
: Show only events from today (UTC). Equivalent to `--after=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`.

**--agent**=*NAME*
: Show only events from the specified agent.

**--event**=*TYPE*
: Show only events of the specified type (request, execution, complete, error, etc.).

**--grep**=*PATTERN*
: Show only events where the message matches the pattern (case-insensitive regex).

**--after**=*DATE*
: Show only events on or after this date (YYYY-MM-DD format).

**--before**=*DATE*
: Show only events before this date (YYYY-MM-DD format).

## OPTIONS

**--format**=*FORMAT*
: Output format. Options:
  - `pretty` — Human-readable columns (default)
  - `json` — Raw JSONL passthrough

**--log-dir**=*PATH*
: Directory containing log files. Defaults to `$AGEN_LOG_DIR` environment variable, or `./logs` if not set.

**--help**
: Display usage information and exit.

**--version**
: Display version number and exit.

## OUTPUT FORMATS

**Pretty format** (default):

```
[06:00:01] data    | request   | Verify backup integrity
[06:00:03] data    | execution | sha256sum /backup/2024-01-15/*
[06:00:04] data    | complete  | All 47 files verified
```

Columns: time (HH:MM:SS), agent name (padded), event type (padded), message.

**JSON format:**

```json
{"ts":"2024-01-15T06:00:01Z","agent":"data","event":"request","message":"Verify backup integrity"}
{"ts":"2024-01-15T06:00:03Z","agent":"data","event":"execution","message":"sha256sum /backup/2024-01-15/*","exit_code":0}
```

Raw JSONL, suitable for piping to `jq` or other tools.

## ENVIRONMENT

**AGEN_LOG_DIR**
: Default directory containing log files. Overridden by `--log-dir`.

## EXIT STATUS

**0** — Results found and displayed

**1** — No results matched the filters (or error occurred)

The exit code enables conditional scripting:

```bash
if agen-audit --today --grep "error"; then
  echo "Errors detected today!"
fi
```

## EXAMPLES

**What did all agents do today?**

```bash
agen-audit --today
```

**What did a specific agent do?**

```bash
agen-audit --agent data --today
```

**What commands were executed?**

```bash
agen-audit --event execution --today
```

**Did anything touch production?**

```bash
agen-audit --today --grep "prod"
```

**Combine filters (AND logic):**

```bash
# Executions by the data agent that mention "backup"
agen-audit --today --agent data --event execution --grep "backup"
```

**Get raw JSON for processing:**

```bash
agen-audit --today --format json | jq 'select(.exit_code != 0)'
```

**Date range queries:**

```bash
# Events from a specific date range
agen-audit --after 2024-01-10 --before 2024-01-15

# Everything since Monday
agen-audit --after 2024-01-15
```

**Use in scripts:**

```bash
# Alert if any errors occurred today
if agen-audit --today --event error --format json | grep -q .; then
  echo "ALERT: Agents encountered errors today"
  agen-audit --today --event error
fi
```

**Compare agents:**

```bash
# What did each agent do today?
for agent in data aurora lore; do
  echo "=== $agent ==="
  agen-audit --today --agent $agent
done
```

## FILES

**$AGEN_LOG_DIR/all.jsonl**
: Combined log file (used when no `--agent` filter is specified).

**$AGEN_LOG_DIR/{agent}.jsonl**
: Per-agent log file (used when `--agent` filter is specified for efficiency).

## SEE ALSO

`agen-log`(1) — create the log entries that agen-audit queries

`agen-memory`(1) — persistent key-value storage for agents

`jq`(1) — JSON processor for advanced queries

## WHEN TO USE AGEN-AUDIT VS. RAW TOOLS

**Use agen-audit when:**
- You want quick answers to common questions
- Date filtering would be tedious to write
- You want pretty-printed output
- You're exploring interactively

**Use raw tools (grep, jq) when:**
- You need complex queries agen-audit doesn't support
- You're building pipelines with other tools
- You want full control over output format
- agen-audit doesn't exist on the target system

Example raw equivalents:

```bash
# agen-audit --today --agent data
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" logs/data.jsonl

# agen-audit --event execution --format json
jq 'select(.event == "execution")' logs/all.jsonl

# agen-audit --grep "backup"
grep -i "backup" logs/all.jsonl | jq .
```

The log format is intentionally simple enough that you never *need* agen-audit. It's a convenience, not a requirement.

## DESIGN NOTES

**Why exit 1 on no results?**

This enables conditional logic in scripts. If you're checking "did any errors happen?", an empty result is meaningful — it means "no, everything was fine." The exit code lets you act on that without parsing output.

**Why is date filtering by string comparison?**

ISO 8601 timestamps sort lexicographically. "2024-01-15" < "2024-01-16" is true as a string comparison. This makes date filtering trivial without date parsing libraries.

**Why both per-agent and combined logs?**

The combined log (`all.jsonl`) lets you see the full picture — what happened across all agents, interleaved. The per-agent logs let you focus on one agent efficiently without scanning irrelevant entries.
